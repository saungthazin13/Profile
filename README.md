Hi  ðŸ‘‹ I'm Saung Thazin Oo. I'm currently learning and building my skills in React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, and API Development. My goal is to become a Full-Stack Developer, and I am excited to continue growing my expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies.
Right now, I'm focusing on building projects that combine my front-end and back-end knowledge to create full-stack applications.
Feel free to explore my repositories, where you can find some of the projects I am working on, and I always appreciate any feedback or collaboration opportunities.
